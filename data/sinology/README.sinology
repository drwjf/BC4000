                   Sinology Freeciv Ruleset
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This ruleset tries to use the new features available in freeciv that
are not yet in use in default rulesets. It is based on the classic ruleset.
The changes can be extracted by

#> diff -ur data/classic/ data/sinology/

If the changes in this ruleset result in a working game (especially with
regard to the AI) they could be included in the default ruleset for next
major release.

If you change the sinology ruleset, please include a short comment in
this file.



1. Changes compared to the classic ruleset
   ---------------------------------------

- Plagues are activated. Temples, Aqueducts, Sewer Systems reduce the
  chance of plague in a city, as do the new Hospital and Genetic Laboratory
  buildings. The effect of Aqueducts is reduced after Industrialization
  is discovered. Building the wonder 'Cure for Cancer' further reduces
  the possibility of plague for your entire empire.

- The Genetic Laboratory increases the food output by 25% if the city
  size exceeds 20.

- Migration is activated and locked by the ruleset. Migration effects for
  the different governments are defined; cities belonging to more
  representative governments are more attractive for cross-border migration.

- After The Corporation is researched, the upkeep for most modern military
  units (Riflemen onwards) is changed from shields to gold, and cities
  no longer maintain any such units for free, regardless of government.
  Gold upkeep for units is tallied empire-wide (unlike buildings), and if
  funds run out, random units are disbanded.

- A new unit class Big Land is introduced, comprising all "siege" units
  (Catapult, Cannon etc) and Freight. Units of this type are restricted
  to flat terrain and cannot move into difficult terrain such as hills
  and forest, unless roads are built; nor can they ride maglevs (they
  ride the railroad instead).
  Freight does not obsolete Caravan so player does not lose ability
  to build units to establish traderoutes to remote cities.

- Triremes can move on rivers (but later ships cannot).

- Mech. Inf. can carry up to 3 missile units (including while they
  themselves are being transported on a boat).

- Workers and Engineers (but not Settlers) have their own veteran system.
  Every turn when they do useful work, there is a small chance that they
  will be promoted. They will never be promoted through combat.
  The levels and their effect on terrain alteration speed are:
  apprentice (1x) -> journeyman (1.25x) -> master (1.5x)

- Activate variable city radii:
    radius 1 (radius_sq =  2): start
    radius 2 (radius_sq =  5): city size 3
    radius 3 (radius_sq = 10): city size 10 + Railroad
    radius 4 (radius_sq = 17): city size 30 + Railroad + Mass Transit +
                               Super Highway
  The vision range of the city is adapted accordingly.
  The city graphics from the tileset change with the city radius.

- The number of build slots for units is increased at radius 3 and 4.

- (Add and) Activate tech upkeep. Beyond a certain technology level, some
  bulbs are required to maintain your civilization's existing knowledge,
  and if not supplied, some techs may be lost. (However, technology is not
  lost in this way during periods of Anarchy.)

- Activate server setting 'foggedborders': your view of foreign borders is
  not updated if you can't currently see the territory.

- Activated 'techlost_recv' and 'techlost_donor': whenever technologies are
  transferred between civilizations, there is a small chance that each of
  the parties will forget the technology in question.

- Most technologies have "root_req" requirements. This means that it is
  not possible to acquire the technology by any means unless you already
  possess its "root_req".

- Citizens of the nationality city owner is in war with are extra unhappy.
  Under most governments all such citizens, under Communism
  and Republic one in every two citizens, and under Democracy one in
  every three citizen is unhappy because of the war against their homeland.

- Custom policy "Personal Freedom". You can trade off a science bonus
  against extra unhappiness from your aggressive military units.

- There's only three disaster types: Earthquake and Fire, which can both
  destroy a building in a city, and Industrial Accident (with Mfg. Plant),
  which causes pollution and population loss.

- Each movement point is divided to 9 fragments instead of 3. IgTer, road,
  and river moves costs have similarly changed to 3 fragments, so they are
  still 1/3 (3/9) of a move. Movement along Railroad costs 1 fragment
  (1/9 movement point), and infinite movement is provided by Maglev (but
  not to Big Land units). You can build Maglevs alongside your Railroads
  once you know Superconductors.

- Partisan appearance does not depend on original builder of the city,
  but number of citizen nationality. If at least 75% of the citizens are of
  old owner's nationality, partisans can appear.

- Paratroopers may paradrop to Transports on any oceanic tile.

- Several achievements are enabled.

- Some buildings accumulate culture. Cultural victory is enabled by
  default (can be changed with 'victories' setting).

- An explorer can establish an embassy to another player

- Workers and Engineers can fortify

- AI players get their traits randomly assigned from a limited range

- Being part of a unit stack won't protect against spy actions.

- Marco Polo's Embassy does not grant new connections, nor embassies, to players
  one has never met. It grants embassy with already met players only.


2. Use the new ruleset
   -------------------

To play a game with the sinology rules, start the server with:
       ./fcser -r data/sinology.serv
or a single player game with
       ./freeciv-gtk3.22 -r data/sinology.serv
(and any other command-line arguments you normally use)

Start the client normally.  The client must be network-compatible
(usually meaning the same or similar version) but otherwise nothing
special is needed.

Note that the Freeciv AI might not play as well with rules other
than standard Freeciv.  The AI is supposed to understand and
utilize all sane rules variations, so please report any AI
failures so that they can be fixed.
